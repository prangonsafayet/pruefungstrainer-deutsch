/**
 * The content layer, keyed by trainer. Every trainer exposes the same shape, so a screen
 * reads `TRAINER_CONTENT[trainer]` and never asks which trainer it is looking at.
 *
 * This barrel is deliberately eager — `validate.cjs` and the content-shape tests read every
 * trainer's content directly through it at build and test time — and deliberately the ONLY
 * eager route to it: importing so much as one named export here pulls in every
 * trainer's exams, curricula, guides and vocabulary banks, because module evaluation runs
 * every import in the file regardless of which export a caller wanted. Application code
 * reaches a trainer's content through `TRAINERS[trainer].loadContent()` in
 * `@shared/config/trainers.ts` (or the `useTrainerContent` hook) instead, which is what
 * lets the bundler key a chunk per trainer. The exam format layer's small, trainer-specific
 * facts (a paper's timings, `findPaper`) are sourced directly from their own files for the
 * same reason — see each format's own `index.ts` under `features/mock-exam/lib/formats` and
 * `@shared/lib/examLookup.ts`.
