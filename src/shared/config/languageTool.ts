/**
 * Where LanguageTool lives and how hard we are willing to lean on it.
 *
 * The public instance at `https://api.languagetool.org` answers `POST /v2/check` with
 * `access-control-allow-origin: *`, so the browser may call it directly: no proxy, no
 * hosting, no key. Its 20-requests-per-minute limit then applies per learner rather than
 * pooled across everyone, which is the right trade for a study app. `VITE_LANGUAGETOOL_URL`
 * overrides that default, pointing at a self-hosted instance — local Docker
 * (`http://localhost:8010`, exempt from mixed-content blocking) or a hosted one with richer
 * n-gram data that catches materially more than the public API does.
 *
 * Because the default always resolves to *something*, "is LanguageTool configured" cannot
 * be "is a base URL non-empty" — that would always be true and the `not-configured` result
 * would never fire. It is instead an explicit build-time switch, `VITE_DYNAMIC_FEEDBACK`, so
 * a build with the flag off behaves exactly like today's app regardless of what the base
 * resolves to.
