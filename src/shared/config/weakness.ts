/**
 * Which curriculum area each weakness belongs to.

 * Deliberately not a category → cheatsheet-key map: the three trainers each own their own
 * cheatsheets under `src/content/<id>/curriculum.ts`, and the keys are unrelated —
 * A2·B1 has twelve (`cases`, `verbpraep`, `nebensaetze`, …), B1 has six
 * (`cases`, `verbs`, `konnektoren`, `schreiben`, `sprechen`, `hoeren`), B2 has six
 * (`genitiv`, `passiv`, `kii`, `nominal`, `brief`, `muendlich`). A single flat map keyed by
 * `WeaknessCategory` cannot resolve to real keys for all three at once.
 *
 * A topic is the portable half of that lookup: every trainer resolves its own cheatsheet
 * keys for a topic in its `TrainerInfo.weaknessCheatsheets` (`@shared/config/trainers.ts`),
 * which is where trainer-specific facts belong. Task 7's adaptive queue links a learner's
 * weakness to a cheatsheet by composing the two: `TRAINERS[trainer].weaknessCheatsheets[
 * WEAKNESS_TOPICS[category]]`.
