/**
 * The trainer registry: one descriptor per trainer, and the only place a per-trainer fact
 * is allowed to live.
 *
 * The trainers are peers, and another one that sets one of the existing papers — telc
 * Deutsch B2 Beruf, say — costs a content folder under `src/content/`, one entry
 * here, and a row in the type-level plumbing that keeps this registry exhaustive and the
 * persisted document typed: `TrainerId`, `SingleLevelTrainerId` if it sets that paper, and a
 * field on `ProgressDatabase` with matching cases in `EMPTY_DATABASE`, `normalizeDatabase`
 * and `mergeProgress`. Plus two more places, both measured rather than assumed by planting a
 * fourth trainer: `src/content/index.ts` and one `vi.mock` in
 * `tests/unit/contentChunks.test.ts`. `.claude/skills/new-trainer/SKILL.md` states the whole list
 * and why each entry is irreducible.
 *
 * No screen, route, hook or nav item needs to learn about it, because everything else in
 * `src/` reads a trainer's facts from this file rather than testing its id — which the
 * `no-restricted-syntax` rule in `eslint.config.js` enforces over the id list it reads back
 * out of this file.
 *
 * A trainer that sets a *new* paper costs much more: another `ExamFormatId`, a whole
 * `features/mock-exam/lib/formats/<new>/`, its module renderers, a `TrainerSlice` variant, an
 * attempt type and eight format-keyed records in `@shared/config/examConditions.ts`.
