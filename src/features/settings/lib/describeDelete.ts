 * What "delete all progress" actually does, in words.

 * The dialog used to say the data "will be removed from this browser. This cannot be undone."
 * Both halves were wrong at once: the write stamps the document, which trips the debounced
 * push, so a signed-in delete has always reached the cloud — and the merge is union-only by
 * design, so any other signed-in device that still holds a copy restores everything on its
 * next sync. Undoing it is exactly what happens by accident.
 *
 * Copy lives here rather than in the card or the hook so there is one wording of it, checked
 * next to the behaviour it describes.
