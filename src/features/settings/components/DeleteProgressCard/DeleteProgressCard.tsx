/**
 * The one destructive action on the page, in a region of its own at the end of it: bounded,
 * tinted and named, so the confirm dialog it opens is the expected next step rather than a
 * surprise from a button that sat in a row with the harmless ones.
 *
 * The warning is a sentence rather than a red chip: `--destructive` as small text on this
 * tint measures 4.43:1 in the light theme, under the 4.5:1 that body text needs, while the
 * same colour as the icon and the button is a graphic at 4.43:1 against the 3:1 it needs.
