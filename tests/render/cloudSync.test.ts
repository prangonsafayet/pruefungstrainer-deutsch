/*
 * Cloud sync retries. The debounced push is gated on having pulled once — pushing before a
 * merge would upsert this device's document over a remote nobody has reconciled with — but
 * the gate was the *only* thing standing between a failed sign-in sync and a session-long
 * stall: every later change was saved locally and never sent until the user signed in again
 * or pressed Sync by hand. The retry is now a full sync, which is safe because it merges.
 *
 * Driven through the hook with a fake Supabase client, the way `examFinish` drives the run
 * machine: the interesting states (a select that fails, then one that does not) are not
 * reachable through the UI.
