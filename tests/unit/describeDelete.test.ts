/*
 * The dialog used to say the data "will be removed from this browser. This cannot be undone."
 * Both halves were wrong at once: the write stamps the document, which trips the debounced
 * push, so a signed-in delete has always reached the cloud — and the merge is union-only, so
 * any other signed-in device that still holds a copy restores everything on its next sync.
 * A dialog that under-promises the blast radius and over-promises finality is worse than no
 * dialog, so the two claims are asserted here rather than left to a reading.
