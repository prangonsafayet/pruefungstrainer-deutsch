/*
 * Whether a trainer's content loads lazily is a fact about the *module graph*, not about a
 * file's size on disk — one static import anywhere in the chain `trainers.ts` pulls in would
 * put every trainer's exams, curriculum, guide and vocabulary bank back in one eager bundle
 * while every byte-count check in the build report kept passing (see Task 10's brief). So
 * this mocks each trainer's content module to record the moment it is first evaluated, then
 * asserts that importing the registry — and reading every eager fact it exposes — never
 * touches any of them, and that resolving one trainer's `loadContent()` touches only its own.
 *
 * `vi.mock` calls are hoisted above the rest of this file, so the state and helper they
 * close over has to come from `vi.hoisted` rather than a plain top-level `const`.
